# Optimal Lot Calculator
The goal of this project is to create a software that determines optimal lot size (Q) and reorder point (R) for a given data. The software should first request the costs (unit cost, ordering cost, penalty cost) and interest rate. Then, it should also determine the holding cost based on the unit cost and interested rate provided. The software should request the lead time, lead time demand, and lead time standard deviation.The software determines the annual demand based on the lead time and lead time demand provided.
